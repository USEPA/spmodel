Description: Fit, summarize, and predict for a variety spatial statistical models. Parameters
    are estimated using various methods. Additional modeling features include anisotropy,
    random effects, partition factors, big data approaches, and more. Model-fit statistics are
    used to summarize, visualize, and compare models. Predictions at unobserved locations are
    readily obtainable.
